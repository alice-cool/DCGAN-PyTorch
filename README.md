### Data Preparation:
CelebA dataset has been used. All images are resized to 64x64. Data are placed into ```data/``` folder.

### Model:
![alt text](./utils/assets/gan_arch.png "Generator")

This is the model we used in our implementation. However, the number of filters in our implementation goes from 512 -> 256 -> 128 -> 64. This can be tuned in the configurations file be editing the variables: ```num_filt_g``` and ```num_filt_d```.
### Experiment configs:
```
- Input size: 64x64x3
- Batch size: 64
- Learning rate: 0.0002
- Betas for Adam: 0.5 and 0.999
- Number of epochs: 30
- Noise vector size: 100
- Starting number of generator filters: 64
- Starting number of discriminator filters: 64
```
### Usage:
- To run the project, you need to add your configurations into the folder configs/. An example of the configurations that should be passed can be found [here](https://github.com/hagerrady13/DCGAN-Pytorch/blob/master/configs/dcgan_exp.json)
- ``` sh run.sh ```
- To run on a GPU, you need to enable cuda in the config file.

### Results:
**Loss**:
